I like to tell our supporters to be patient until the right opportunity comes,” he said. He said the party should either remain in the opposition or in the government. Mr. Ratwatte said the situation in the country was so complicated now and seems as if the war victory would be reversed. “The LTTE is raising its head again.

With more than 80% of seats declared, Aung San Suu Kyi''s party has more than the two-thirds it needs to control parliament and choose the president. But a quarter of seats are allocated to the military, which means it will remain hugely influential. Myanmar''s constitution means Ms. Suu Kyi cannot now become president. It specifically bars anyone whose children were born foreign nationals from holding the job. Both her sons were born British. But Ms. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who spent decades under military-imposed house arrest, has insisted she would lead the country anyway if her party won. Sunday''s election was the first openly contested poll in Myanmar in 25 years. It was widely seen as a fair vote though there were reports of irregularities, and hundreds of thousands of people - including the Muslim Rohingya minority, who are not recognised as citizens - were denied voting rights. About 30 million people were eligible to vote and turnout was estimated at about 80%. The ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) - which won the last, widely criticised election five years ago - has so far gained about 5% of seats contested.', 'Suu Kyi''s National League wins majority in Myanmar', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/95177/league-wins-majority-in-myanmar', 1),

Tea Board Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda was also present at the occasion.    The global campaign was proposed to focus within seven identified regions, namely Russia/CIS, Middle-East/Gulf, African, Far East Oceania, European, American and South Asian regions. In the first phase, the global campaign will focus on 12 markets during 2015/2016 and the rest will be considered during the second phase. The USA, UAE, UK, Japan, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Germany, China, Australia and India will come under the first phase.  Tea, once the number one foreign exchange earner, is now lagging behind remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad and the apparel industry. The industry has been beleaguered by high costs of production, low productivity and incoherent and inconsistent policies. While the new administration will address these issues, the launch of a campaign of this nature is considered most desirable by the tea industry.    ', 'Agreement signed for Ceylon tea global campaign ', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/94633/agreement-signed-for-ceylon-tea-global-campaign', 2),

Hence, tax revenue, which has come down to mere 10.85 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to go up to 15-16 percent of the GDP from the 2016 budget.   “I want to ensure, we will collect a minimum of 14-15 percent (tax revenue of GDP),” Karunanayake confided delivering the keynote address at a seminar on taxation conducted by the Sri Lanka Branch of International Fiscal Association.      Sri Lanka’s curious case of an expanding economy with falling tax revenues as a percentage of GDP has been an economic paradox.  Sri Lanka has the lowest tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in the South Asian region and this has been a top fiscal reform continuously called for by the International Monetary Fund.  According to the Finance Minister, Sri Lanka’s tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.6 percent.  However, Karunanayake said the burden will not be passed on to the public; instead they will go hard on the tax defaulters. “Today the problem is not that the people are not paying. People who can afford to pay are the ones who are not paying.  And I give a wake-up call for them,” the irate Finance Minister told the packed house.  Sri Lanka now operates with over 30 taxes making the tax structure, administration and compliance extremely difficult but a much simplified tax framework is expected to be introduced in the budget 2016.  ', 'Massive increase in tax revenues from budget 2016  ', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/94099/massive-increase-in-tax-revenues-from-budget-2016', 2),
