The International Astronomical Center (IAC) and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency hosted a rapid response team to study the re-entry of what was almost certainly an old rocket stage. In an airplane window high above the clouds, the crew, which included Peter Jenniskens, Mike Koop and Jim Albers of the SETI Institute along with German, UK and United Arab Emirates astronomers, took still images, video and gathered high-resolution spectra of the breakup. The group of seven astronomers hoped to study the WT1190F’s re-entry as a  test case for future asteroid entries as well as improve our understanding of space debris behavior. Photos and video show the object breaking up into multiple pieces in a swift but brief fireball. From the spectra, the team should be able to better determine the object’s nature — whether natural or manmade.

The selling and serving of food with excessive salt, excessive sugar and oily foods should be minimized in school canteens and food outlets. The Health Ministry has recruited a number of Endocrinologists specialized in treating diabetes for the control of the disease.

(6, '2015-11-13', '\nRanjini, a Sri Lankan mother of three who has spent more than three years in detention after being deemed a national security threat by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), has been freed, Sydney Morning Herald said. The Tamil refugee was given no reason why she was considered a security risk when she was whisked into detention in May 2012 - and was similarly given no explanation for her unannounced release on Thursday. “She is very happy and extremely relieved," her lawyer, David Manne, said on Friday after Ranjini''s first day of freedom included walking her two older boys, aged 9 and 11, to school. Her third child, an Australian citizen, was born in detention after the pregnancy was confirmed two days after she was flown with her boys from Melbourne to Sydney''s Villawood detention centre. Ranjini was one of more than 50 Tamil Sri Lankans who were deemed security threats despite having refugee status and were then indefinitely detained. Most have since been quietly released without reason after their adverse security assessments were lifted. Although Ranjini''s husband Ganesh is an Australian citizen and she is recognised as a refugee, she does not know what visa she will be offered. "She is looking forward to being able to rebuild her life with her husband and three boys with certainty of a safe future," Mr. Manne told Fairfax Media. Ranjini, 36, whose first husband died in the Sri Lankan civil war, arrived on Christmas Island in April 2010 and spent time with her two boys in detention centres in Perth and Adelaide before being released into community detention in Brisbane in April 2011. Her refugee status was recognised six months later. Then, with the apparent blessing of immigration officials, she married Ganesh, a Tamil refugee she met in Brisbane, moved to Melbourne and enrolled her two boys at Mill Park Primary before ASIO deemed her a security risk. A High Court challenge to her indefinite detention found an error of law had been made in her case, but did not reopen the question of whether her indefinite detention was lawful. Mr. Manne said the family had endured "profound distress" while she was in detention and she remained concerned about those whose adverse security assessments remained in force. Trevor Grant, a convenor at the Tamil Refugee Council said: "We are overjoyed to see Ranjini released. I spoke to her by telephone last night and see was laughing and giggling so much it was hard to understand her. "She has shown great courage and resilience, being forced to bring up three children behind bars for most of her time in Villawood. Her husband Ganesh has been equally strong. We are confident they will recover. "But justice still has not been done. As the UN demanded more than two years ago, all these indefinitely detained refugees not only have to be released but also compensated. We will continue to campaign for this." Mr. Grant said the incarceration of more than 50 ASIO-negative refugees, most of whom were Tamil, had been a stain on this country''s democracy. "As far as we are concerned, it was part of a political stunt designed to scare off Tamil asylum-seekers," he said.', 'Lankan mother deemed a security threat, freed', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/95205/lankan-mother-deemed-a-security-threat-freed', 1),

With Polaris’ 7,000 employees, the combined entity will have 18,000 employees.  The combined entity will have access to 10 of the world’s twenty biggest banks among which Citigroup will become the largest client of Virtusa-Polaris.   Pre-acquisition, Citigroup accounted for 45 percent or US $ 140 million of Polaris’s revenue.  The acquisition will enable Virtusa to provide end-to-end digital banking and IT solutions for the BFS sector in all areas of banking such as consumer and retail banking as well as corporate and investment banking where Polaris is strong at.  “This acquisition helps us create a fully integrated leader in financial services technology and operations. It basically brings together under one umbrella, the consumer banking, corporate banking and investment banking enabling us to provide end-to-end banking services, greatly expanding Virtusa’s addressable market,” Canekeratne further said.  The acquisition is estimated to result in revenue synergies to the tune of US $ 100 million over the next three fiscal years.  According to Virtusa Sri Lanka operation’s Senior Vice President and General Manager, Madu Ratnayake Sri Lanka’s IT/BPO services export revenue is expected to top US $ 840 million by the end of this year and will close in the targeted US $ 1 billion by the end of 2016.

The Cabinet approved it in April, and we started consultations in May and we will continue until the end of this year. We will have to launch the plan by February next year,” University of Moratuwa Department of Town & Country Planning Professor P. K. S. Mahanama said. Urban Development Authority Director General Nayana Mawilmada said that task forces have been set up to look into each matter such as waste disposal, land use, housing, transport, funding from the private sector for infrastructure and operations, etc. Prof. Mahanama noted that the plan has already been gazetted—possibly referring to the Megapolis Plan of the 2002 United National Party government, which included the Port City. “It is a good plan and the government has good policies,” he added, speaking at the LBR/LBO Infrastructure Summit 2015. Last month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on Singapore’s CESMA International Pte Ltd, which created the Megapolis plan in 2002, to revise the plan.  He had in the past said that the project would take decades and cost up to US$ 300 billion, which will be financed through bond issues. However, the public and wider stakeholders are unable to comprehensively engage in the development of the plan, as, while the project website has a contact form, its ‘plans’ and ‘forum’ sections say ‘under construction and sorry for any inconvenience’. TWCorp Founder Chairman/CEO and former Board of Investments Chief Thilan Wijesinghe noted that when creating such a mega city, some people would inevitably be left out, and that the government must leave out their egos when developing and implementing the project. “There seems to have been a lot of plans but we seem to have failed and destroyed the city,” he added. University of Moratuwa Transport and Logistics Management Department Senior Lecturer Professor Amal Kumarage agreed that Colombo has failed in its planning time, and that this will be the last chance for Colombo to get its planning right if it wants to compete globally. Prof. Mahanama guaranteed that Megapolis will be holistic, integrative, sustainable, equitable and inclusive for all citizens by promoting economic growth, social harmony, institutional governance, special configurations and environmental sustainability. “We will make it a smart city and a global city like London, where 6 out of 10 are not British. But for that we have to change our mentality and bring in policy changes,” he said. However, Urban Transport Expert Guido Bruggemen said that Sri Lanka must be careful when taking on such a big challenge, and replace ‘smart city’ with a ‘happy city’. “Will Colombo be Colombo or become a copy of another city? People in Colombo have to be themselves. You have lot of elements. Which city has a lake in the middle? What will happen to Pettah? Will it be gentrified? You must use all your unique elements,” he said. Prof. Mahanama went on to say that the Megapolis will affect all citizens of the country, as all depend on the Western Region for growth. “All 22 million people are connected to Colombo, and without Colombo no one can survive.

He then showed the government’s physical infrastructure plan for 2030, which has Hambantota, Batticaloa and Jaffna becoming urban centres, with the Trincomalee area becoming a larger urban centre than the Western Province by including areas up to Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.

Hence, tax revenue, which has come down to mere 10.85 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to go up to 15-16 percent of the GDP from the 2016 budget.   “I want to ensure, we will collect a minimum of 14-15 percent (tax revenue of GDP),” Karunanayake confided delivering the keynote address at a seminar on taxation conducted by the Sri Lanka Branch of International Fiscal Association.      Sri Lanka’s curious case of an expanding economy with falling tax revenues as a percentage of GDP has been an economic paradox.  Sri Lanka has the lowest tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in the South Asian region and this has been a top fiscal reform continuously called for by the International Monetary Fund.  According to the Finance Minister, Sri Lanka’s tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.6 percent.  However, Karunanayake said the burden will not be passed on to the public; instead they will go hard on the tax defaulters. “Today the problem is not that the people are not paying. People who can afford to pay are the ones who are not paying.  And I give a wake-up call for them,” the irate Finance Minister told the packed house.  Sri Lanka now operates with over 30 taxes making the tax structure, administration and compliance extremely difficult but a much simplified tax framework is expected to be introduced in the budget 2016.  ', 'Massive increase in tax revenues from budget 2016  ', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/94099/massive-increase-in-tax-revenues-from-budget-2016', 2),

Just a fortnight before being voted in as IAAF president Coe had described allegations of a widespread cover-up of doping in athletics, as a “declaration of war” on his sport.\nExplaining that comment, he told reporters this week: “I’ve clarified this previously and I’ll say again that the comment was made in frustration about the selective use of data to besmirch clean athletes, and I made that clear at the time.\n“It was not a criticism of any journalism or any media. It was simply a reaction to the selective use of data to call into question the reputation of clean athletes.”\nCoe’s close connection with Diack is now also under the spotlight, with the Senegalese official being investigated by French police over allegations he received bribes to cover up positive doping tests when he was in charge.\n“He will always be our spiritual president and he will certainly be my spiritual president,” Coe said on succeeding Diack, adding that he had served the perfect apprenticeship as Diack’s right-hand man as vice-president for seven years.\nDiack has not publicly commented on the French investigation.\nCoe was asked during an interview with the BBC on Sunday if he now regretted his Diack comments.\n“I’m well aware I’m going to come in for criticism for those remarks,” Coe said. “It does presume I had a list of allegations in front of me at that moment, and I didn’t.”\nCoe is also facing questions about a potential conflict of interest over his role as a brand ambassador for Nike. The sportswear giant has substantial influence within the sport and is a sponsor of the American former Olympic sprint champion Justin Gatlin, who has twice failed drugs tests.\nCoe does not consider there to be a conflict, telling the Times in September that his relationship with the U.S. sportswear manufacturer was public knowledge, he had followed the rules, and had not done anything untoward.\nBritish MP Damian Collins has already said he will raise the matter if Coe appears before a parliamentary select committee before Christmas to answer questions about the Russian crisis.\nOn Monday, Canadian Dick Pound, who chaired the independent commission that recommended Russia’s suspension, was asked if Coe was the right man to lead athletics out of its crisis.\n“I think he is. I think Seb Coe is somebody who can grasp this and can be transformational enough to effect some change in athletics. I hope so because his sport is at risk if he doesn’t,” he said.\nCoe says he is the right man for the job and many of the ideas he campaigned on, such as an independent anti-doping operation and wholesale reviews of the IAAFs structures and practices, have been welcomed.\n“I won’t fail, but I also accept that this is a huge journey,” he told an audience at a promotional event in London on Tuesday. “This isn’t six weeks to fit thighs; this is a long journey and we have to start somewhere, and I know what I have to do.”', 'Coe in the spotlight as world athletics ponders Russia ban', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/13/coe-in-the-spotlight-as-world-athletics-ponders-russia-ban/', 5),
