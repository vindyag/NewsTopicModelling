The International Astronomical Center (IAC) and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency hosted a rapid response team to study the re-entry of what was almost certainly an old rocket stage. In an airplane window high above the clouds, the crew, which included Peter Jenniskens, Mike Koop and Jim Albers of the SETI Institute along with German, UK and United Arab Emirates astronomers, took still images, video and gathered high-resolution spectra of the breakup. The group of seven astronomers hoped to study the WT1190F’s re-entry as a  test case for future asteroid entries as well as improve our understanding of space debris behavior. Photos and video show the object breaking up into multiple pieces in a swift but brief fireball. From the spectra, the team should be able to better determine the object’s nature — whether natural or manmade.

The selling and serving of food with excessive salt, excessive sugar and oily foods should be minimized in school canteens and food outlets. The Health Ministry has recruited a number of Endocrinologists specialized in treating diabetes for the control of the disease.

(6, '2015-11-13', '\nRanjini, a Sri Lankan mother of three who has spent more than three years in detention after being deemed a national security threat by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), has been freed, Sydney Morning Herald said. The Tamil refugee was given no reason why she was considered a security risk when she was whisked into detention in May 2012 - and was similarly given no explanation for her unannounced release on Thursday. “She is very happy and extremely relieved," her lawyer, David Manne, said on Friday after Ranjini''s first day of freedom included walking her two older boys, aged 9 and 11, to school. Her third child, an Australian citizen, was born in detention after the pregnancy was confirmed two days after she was flown with her boys from Melbourne to Sydney''s Villawood detention centre. Ranjini was one of more than 50 Tamil Sri Lankans who were deemed security threats despite having refugee status and were then indefinitely detained. Most have since been quietly released without reason after their adverse security assessments were lifted. Although Ranjini''s husband Ganesh is an Australian citizen and she is recognised as a refugee, she does not know what visa she will be offered. "She is looking forward to being able to rebuild her life with her husband and three boys with certainty of a safe future," Mr. Manne told Fairfax Media. Ranjini, 36, whose first husband died in the Sri Lankan civil war, arrived on Christmas Island in April 2010 and spent time with her two boys in detention centres in Perth and Adelaide before being released into community detention in Brisbane in April 2011. Her refugee status was recognised six months later. Then, with the apparent blessing of immigration officials, she married Ganesh, a Tamil refugee she met in Brisbane, moved to Melbourne and enrolled her two boys at Mill Park Primary before ASIO deemed her a security risk. A High Court challenge to her indefinite detention found an error of law had been made in her case, but did not reopen the question of whether her indefinite detention was lawful. Mr. Manne said the family had endured "profound distress" while she was in detention and she remained concerned about those whose adverse security assessments remained in force. Trevor Grant, a convenor at the Tamil Refugee Council said: "We are overjoyed to see Ranjini released. I spoke to her by telephone last night and see was laughing and giggling so much it was hard to understand her. "She has shown great courage and resilience, being forced to bring up three children behind bars for most of her time in Villawood. Her husband Ganesh has been equally strong. We are confident they will recover. "But justice still has not been done. As the UN demanded more than two years ago, all these indefinitely detained refugees not only have to be released but also compensated. We will continue to campaign for this." Mr. Grant said the incarceration of more than 50 ASIO-negative refugees, most of whom were Tamil, had been a stain on this country''s democracy. "As far as we are concerned, it was part of a political stunt designed to scare off Tamil asylum-seekers," he said.', 'Lankan mother deemed a security threat, freed', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/95205/lankan-mother-deemed-a-security-threat-freed', 1),

With Polaris’ 7,000 employees, the combined entity will have 18,000 employees.  The combined entity will have access to 10 of the world’s twenty biggest banks among which Citigroup will become the largest client of Virtusa-Polaris.   Pre-acquisition, Citigroup accounted for 45 percent or US $ 140 million of Polaris’s revenue.  The acquisition will enable Virtusa to provide end-to-end digital banking and IT solutions for the BFS sector in all areas of banking such as consumer and retail banking as well as corporate and investment banking where Polaris is strong at.  “This acquisition helps us create a fully integrated leader in financial services technology and operations. It basically brings together under one umbrella, the consumer banking, corporate banking and investment banking enabling us to provide end-to-end banking services, greatly expanding Virtusa’s addressable market,” Canekeratne further said.  The acquisition is estimated to result in revenue synergies to the tune of US $ 100 million over the next three fiscal years.  According to Virtusa Sri Lanka operation’s Senior Vice President and General Manager, Madu Ratnayake Sri Lanka’s IT/BPO services export revenue is expected to top US $ 840 million by the end of this year and will close in the targeted US $ 1 billion by the end of 2016.

The Cabinet approved it in April, and we started consultations in May and we will continue until the end of this year. We will have to launch the plan by February next year,” University of Moratuwa Department of Town & Country Planning Professor P. K. S. Mahanama said. Urban Development Authority Director General Nayana Mawilmada said that task forces have been set up to look into each matter such as waste disposal, land use, housing, transport, funding from the private sector for infrastructure and operations, etc. Prof. Mahanama noted that the plan has already been gazetted—possibly referring to the Megapolis Plan of the 2002 United National Party government, which included the Port City. “It is a good plan and the government has good policies,” he added, speaking at the LBR/LBO Infrastructure Summit 2015. Last month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on Singapore’s CESMA International Pte Ltd, which created the Megapolis plan in 2002, to revise the plan.  He had in the past said that the project would take decades and cost up to US$ 300 billion, which will be financed through bond issues. However, the public and wider stakeholders are unable to comprehensively engage in the development of the plan, as, while the project website has a contact form, its ‘plans’ and ‘forum’ sections say ‘under construction and sorry for any inconvenience’. TWCorp Founder Chairman/CEO and former Board of Investments Chief Thilan Wijesinghe noted that when creating such a mega city, some people would inevitably be left out, and that the government must leave out their egos when developing and implementing the project. “There seems to have been a lot of plans but we seem to have failed and destroyed the city,” he added. University of Moratuwa Transport and Logistics Management Department Senior Lecturer Professor Amal Kumarage agreed that Colombo has failed in its planning time, and that this will be the last chance for Colombo to get its planning right if it wants to compete globally. Prof. Mahanama guaranteed that Megapolis will be holistic, integrative, sustainable, equitable and inclusive for all citizens by promoting economic growth, social harmony, institutional governance, special configurations and environmental sustainability. “We will make it a smart city and a global city like London, where 6 out of 10 are not British. But for that we have to change our mentality and bring in policy changes,” he said. However, Urban Transport Expert Guido Bruggemen said that Sri Lanka must be careful when taking on such a big challenge, and replace ‘smart city’ with a ‘happy city’. “Will Colombo be Colombo or become a copy of another city? People in Colombo have to be themselves. You have lot of elements. Which city has a lake in the middle? What will happen to Pettah? Will it be gentrified? You must use all your unique elements,” he said. Prof. Mahanama went on to say that the Megapolis will affect all citizens of the country, as all depend on the Western Region for growth. “All 22 million people are connected to Colombo, and without Colombo no one can survive.

He then showed the government’s physical infrastructure plan for 2030, which has Hambantota, Batticaloa and Jaffna becoming urban centres, with the Trincomalee area becoming a larger urban centre than the Western Province by including areas up to Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.

Hence, tax revenue, which has come down to mere 10.85 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to go up to 15-16 percent of the GDP from the 2016 budget.   “I want to ensure, we will collect a minimum of 14-15 percent (tax revenue of GDP),” Karunanayake confided delivering the keynote address at a seminar on taxation conducted by the Sri Lanka Branch of International Fiscal Association.      Sri Lanka’s curious case of an expanding economy with falling tax revenues as a percentage of GDP has been an economic paradox.  Sri Lanka has the lowest tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in the South Asian region and this has been a top fiscal reform continuously called for by the International Monetary Fund.  According to the Finance Minister, Sri Lanka’s tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.6 percent.  However, Karunanayake said the burden will not be passed on to the public; instead they will go hard on the tax defaulters. “Today the problem is not that the people are not paying. People who can afford to pay are the ones who are not paying.  And I give a wake-up call for them,” the irate Finance Minister told the packed house.  Sri Lanka now operates with over 30 taxes making the tax structure, administration and compliance extremely difficult but a much simplified tax framework is expected to be introduced in the budget 2016.  ', 'Massive increase in tax revenues from budget 2016  ', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/94099/massive-increase-in-tax-revenues-from-budget-2016', 2),

Just a fortnight before being voted in as IAAF president Coe had described allegations of a widespread cover-up of doping in athletics, as a “declaration of war” on his sport.\nExplaining that comment, he told reporters this week: “I’ve clarified this previously and I’ll say again that the comment was made in frustration about the selective use of data to besmirch clean athletes, and I made that clear at the time.\n“It was not a criticism of any journalism or any media. It was simply a reaction to the selective use of data to call into question the reputation of clean athletes.”\nCoe’s close connection with Diack is now also under the spotlight, with the Senegalese official being investigated by French police over allegations he received bribes to cover up positive doping tests when he was in charge.\n“He will always be our spiritual president and he will certainly be my spiritual president,” Coe said on succeeding Diack, adding that he had served the perfect apprenticeship as Diack’s right-hand man as vice-president for seven years.\nDiack has not publicly commented on the French investigation.\nCoe was asked during an interview with the BBC on Sunday if he now regretted his Diack comments.\n“I’m well aware I’m going to come in for criticism for those remarks,” Coe said. “It does presume I had a list of allegations in front of me at that moment, and I didn’t.”\nCoe is also facing questions about a potential conflict of interest over his role as a brand ambassador for Nike. The sportswear giant has substantial influence within the sport and is a sponsor of the American former Olympic sprint champion Justin Gatlin, who has twice failed drugs tests.\nCoe does not consider there to be a conflict, telling the Times in September that his relationship with the U.S. sportswear manufacturer was public knowledge, he had followed the rules, and had not done anything untoward.\nBritish MP Damian Collins has already said he will raise the matter if Coe appears before a parliamentary select committee before Christmas to answer questions about the Russian crisis.\nOn Monday, Canadian Dick Pound, who chaired the independent commission that recommended Russia’s suspension, was asked if Coe was the right man to lead athletics out of its crisis.\n“I think he is. I think Seb Coe is somebody who can grasp this and can be transformational enough to effect some change in athletics. I hope so because his sport is at risk if he doesn’t,” he said.\nCoe says he is the right man for the job and many of the ideas he campaigned on, such as an independent anti-doping operation and wholesale reviews of the IAAFs structures and practices, have been welcomed.\n“I won’t fail, but I also accept that this is a huge journey,” he told an audience at a promotional event in London on Tuesday. “This isn’t six weeks to fit thighs; this is a long journey and we have to start somewhere, and I know what I have to do.”', 'Coe in the spotlight as world athletics ponders Russia ban', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/13/coe-in-the-spotlight-as-world-athletics-ponders-russia-ban/', 5),

Apart from India matches, Chennai will also not host any of the matches involving Sri Lanka, given the political scenario in the state and the Tamil-Sinhala conflict. BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur admitted that there were problems with the stadium in Chennai because of which the listing of World T20 venues had to be kept pending. "We have not ruled out Chennai (as a venue). The only issue is which matches can be played in Chennai. There are certain limitations - can''t play Sri Lanka there, three stands are not complete and you can''t keep Indian fans away from those stands," said the BCCI secretary. Thakur, however, did not go into the specifics of whether Chennai would get to host the Indian team. The BCCI has not kept any venues on standby for the tournament as all eight centres originally listed during the International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in Barbados are being included in the itinerary. Delhi, a major venue that is currently in a messy state of affairs over tax-related issues with the state government, could also miss out on a World T20 game. There is no confirmation yet over the number of venues that have been shortlisted for the tournament. "We held a de tailed discussion today.

(140, '2015-11-20', '\nThe board of directors of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, the state-owned entity which owns Grand Hyatt Colombo, has not changed as the Public Enterprise Development Ministry stated, and is still working efficiently towards the completion of the project, a top official affirmed. With contradictory statements coming out of the woodwork over the Grand Hyatt issue, Mirror Business contacted Canwill Holdings Managing Director D. R. P. Abeysinghe, who was appointed to the post in February following the regime change. “The current board is operating, and we’re going on with our work,” Abeysinghe said. Yesterday, a Public Enterprise Development Ministry statement said that a new director board has been appointed to Canwill Holdings, and that they are consulting a wide range of professionals to ensure that the project is completed without delays by 2017. However, it is not clear as to whether changes can be made to state-sector boards without Presidential approval, according to a letter sent by President Maithripala Sirisena to all Ministries in September. Yet, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim had written to Canwill’s largest shareholder Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) on November 5, asking it to change Canwill’s board.  Hashim, under whose purview SLIC now falls following cabinet restructuring in September, is also attempting to change the board of SLIC, as reported by Daily Mirror this week. High up sources had said that the rationale behind Hashim’s decision in attempting to change the Canwill board was due to his dissatisfaction over the tender procedures of the current board. Abeysinghe assured that all tenders have been following the rules of procurement set by the Treasury. “We have published our tenders on newspapers, and on the day of opening tenders, we bring our 3 shareholders and the bidders together, so there is complete transparency,” he said. On October 5, the Ministry had also called for all tenders to be halted. Grand Hyatt Project Consultant and Senior Architect Dr. Ravihansa Chandratilake said that the delay is causing the project Rs.2 million daily due to idling. “The bidders think that we are currently evaluating their proposals, so when the Ministry decides to re-open the tenders, we will have to ask for an extension,” Abeysinghe added. He noted that two bidders who had submitted proposals of around US$15 million for a tender under the past regime have now submitted bids of around US$10-11 million when the same tender was reopened early last month. Chandratilake said that the board has re-negotiated deals struck under the past regime and saved over Rs.1 billion in costs so far. Abeysinghe assured that the current board of directors have acted professionally in all aspects of managing the project. The current board of directors consists of representatives from the 3 state-owned shareholders—Sri  Lanka  Insurance Corporation, the Employee Provident Fund and Litro Gas Lanka Ltd—as well as representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the private sector. In addition to Abeysinghe, SLIC Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya acts as Canwill Chairman, while Ministry of Finance Deputy Director P. Liyanage, Engineer Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, Litro Gas Chairman S. Munasinghe, EPF Superintendant R. A. A. Jayalath and S. D. Martino are present in the board. Sources said that the director board Hashim wants to appoint consists of hoteliers Upul Gamage and Prajantha Ratwatte, expatriate Pradeep Liyanamanne, Chandralal Colombage and Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzammil’s son Rahaman Muzammil. An undesirable culture in the Sri Lankan state sector is that boards and top bureaucrats are expected to resign following changes of regime or ministers without taking into consideration the performances of the individuals.

In that sense the pure Ceylon Tea concept, it is questionable,” Minister of Plantations Industries Navin Dissanayake told Mirror Business during an interview. He added he was open to any suggestion in this regard and implied it was his ultimate focus to project the brand that promises to offer the finest tea in the world. Acknowledging the delay in launching the global tea campaign has contributed in the Ceylon Tea brand losing its presence in the global space, Dissanayake expressed confidence in the promotion exercise kicking off by early January. The Ceylon Tea campaign, for which a CESS of Rs.3.50 is imposed for every kilo exported, failed to take off with the previous management of the Sri Lanka Tea Board delaying to reach a consensus as to what the concept should entail. Dissanayake, noting the exercise was long overdue, stressed the execution of the marketing plan must be in place. “We have about US $ 50 million to utilize in promoting Ceylon Tea and it will be done in a transparent manner for the benefit of the tea industry. We have all stakeholders making a representation in the Tea Board who are open to give us inputs on how and where we can have the campaign,” he said, while noting the reach of the campaign is equally important to ensure maximum impact.

(155, '2015-11-20', '\nDisclosing another dimension of the national unity government’s new economic policy, a senior government bureaucrat said the new administration would not continue the traditional policy of industry protectionism, unless in an extreme case of national significance, instead would create a level playing field with free capital and trade to promote healthy competition.  While this policy could be unpopular, “all the time, we cannot expect the government to protect the industries,” said Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.M.K.B. Tennakoon.  He said the government was considering establishing a new institute for promoting competitiveness among the industrialists.  Hence, the government urged the industrialists to leverage their value chains, trade and marketing strategies to build competitiveness both locally and internationally without knocking on the door of the treasury for reliefs and concessions.  Speaking at the 12th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council, Tennakoon told that the industries should not depend on the government for relief all the time and the forthcoming budget has also curtailed a lot of such unnecessary expenditure to spend on promoting investments and competition.  “We cannot sustain the belief that the government must provide all services and solutions,” he added.  The former regime pursued the economic policy of increasing exports while curtailing imports via import taxes and import substitution under the guise of protecting the local industries. But this strategy proved to be highly counterproductive.  While free trade benefits the ordinary Sri Lankan, narrowing competition will only benefit the crony capitalists. On the contrary, under the new regime, Sri Lanka is to pursue a pro-Western trade and foreign policy and the government is mulling free trading agreements (FTAs) with Singapore and the United States while deepening the existing FTAs with India and Pakistan.  According to Tennakoon, Pakistani Premier is due in Sri Lanka in January while the Indian Prime Minister is also expected by May 2016.  “Therefore, there will be a free flow of capital, free flow of goods and free flow of personnel,” he added.  The government’s industrial policy recognizes the industries as the live wire in the Sri Lankan economy and the ministry has submitted a policy paper designing the action plan for the small and medium enterprise sector development.    Sri Lanka has bypassed industrialization to become a service economy and the sector comprises of little over 30 percent of gross domestic product while the service sector accounts for 60 percent.  ', 'No more protectionist policies for industries under new regime', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/95991/no-more-protectionist-policies-for-industries-under-new-regime', 9),
(156, '2015-11-20', '\nSays country seeks stronger trade ties with US By Chandeepa Wettasinghe The country’s trade and foreign policy will be hugely pro-western going forward, according to the Deputy Foreign Minister who was speaking at the US Trade Show organized by the US Embassy and the American Chamber of Commerce at the Galadari Hotel yesterday.  “The government is seriously interested in plugging this country to the western world, so that we could create high paying jobs, and link both the rural and urban populations to the rest of the world,” Dr. Harsha de Silva said. He said that during his visit to the US last month, he had received a ‘fantastic reception’ indicating a significant shift in bilateral relations between the two countries for the better. “The right time has now arrived for all of us to redouble our efforts to form stronger relationships and stronger trade relationship with the US,”  Dr. de Silva added. He stressed that the existing free trade agreements (FTA) with Pakistan and India, while theoretically advantageous, have run into multiple problems. However, the government intends to sign a Broader Economic Technology Partnership with India in mid-2016. The recent FTA negotiations with China which have now been halted too had had concerns of para tariffs, non-tariff barriers and mutual standards similar to the cases of India and Pakistan. Dr. de Silva said that since the Doha Rounds on liberalizing global trade has come to a standstill, Sri Lanka must form useful trade agreements with its biggest customers. “We need to find friends who want to trade with us and do deals with those friends. Perhaps one can argue that it is not in the best interest of the world. But who cares about the best interests of the world? We care about the interests of our countries together,” he said. He noted that the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement discussions with the US which were halted when the regime changed in 2004 have been restarted, and Sri Lanka has asked to be included in the Trans Pacific Partnership, but in a realistic note said that results would be a long way ahead. Sri Lanka is also seeking to resume preferential access to the European Union with the GSP+ facility, which was revoked due to political reasons under the past regime. The government’s western aligned policy seems to align with its export-driven policy, as of the country’s apparel exports, which formed 44 percent of the country’s total export revenue, or US$.4.7 billion, the US absorbed US$1.99 billion and the EU absorbed US$ 2.17 billion in 2014. Out of the total exports for last year, the EU accounted for 31 percent and the US accounted for 24 percent. “We like the Americans coming here and partnering with us, because it is still our largest buyer. It is not the days where politicians came up to the stage and said not to use Google and don’t drink Coca Cola. That era is gone. We welcome you to use Google and drink Coca Cola,” he said. While the past regime had tilted towards China to the point of alienating the western powers, the new regime in January said that it would maintain a non-aligned status, possibly due to the amount of Chinese foreign direct investments and loans in the country. Policy stability key to attract investments US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap said that the world has seen tremendous business opportunities in Sri Lanka since the change of regime, but said that policy stability is crucial to finally attract foreign parties. “The people of Sri Lanka have made clear their intent to leave aside the politics of the past in order to build a promising and unified future, and the government of Sri Lanka has brought in policies to make it easier to do business, operate here, and trade with Sri Lanka, not just for the US, but the rest of the world,” he said. While noting that geographical positioning of Sri Lanka makes the country attractive for trans-shipment and assembling operations, he said that the political change observed is even a bigger boon. “It is clear to me that there is a new and tremendous opportunity for business ties between Sri Lanka and the US. I believe we can do a lot together to enhance the economic relationship and expand our bilateral trade. However, he said that US companies tend to set up business in countries which have safe, stable and transparent regulatory and policy environments. “Representatives of US companies have told me that they would like to see more economic policy consistency, a more fiscally stable government, and sustainable and more transparent policies,” he said. Keshap said that he hoped the government and business communities in Sri Lanka work together to achieve these goals.  ', 'Sri Lanka set to pursue pro-western trade and foreign policy: Harsha', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/95803/sri-lanka-set-to-pursue-pro-western-trade-and-foreign-policy-harsha', 9),

Federer pounced on set point, forcing an error.\nFederer was in full flow in the second set, leading 4-1, but Nishikori refused to slink away quietly and took the next five games with some delightful shot-making.\nHis crucial break at 4-4 came courtesy of an ugly forehand swipe from Federer who hit the ball several metres out with the court at his mercy.\nFederer looked tired and tetchy early in the third, even offering an expletive, but crucially hung in from 0-40 down to hold serve, before breaking to move 4-1 ahead.\nAgain Nishikori stormed back to 4-4, but this time Federer steadied down, found four first serves in the nick of time, then broke for the match with a winning smash.\nWith a maximum of two matches left in a season which has already brought six titles, Federer said he is in the mood to go out on a high.\n“I’ve got the perfect schedule. I’m off before the semis, which is huge. Now you’re looking at potentially a maximum of two more matches and the season’s over then,” he said.\n“It’s going to be tough in the sense to win.

(199, '2015-11-20', '\nLionel Messi’s return from injury looks to be coming at exactly the right time for Barcelona as he gears up for a reunion with Neymar and Luis Suarez for Saturday’s La Liga ‘Clasico’ at Real Madrid.\n\nThe most lethal attacking trio in Spanish soccer history have not played together since Argentina’s Messi injured a knee at the end of September, during which time Brazilforward Neymar and Uruguay striker Suarez have flourished.\nNeymar has thrived on the extra creative responsibility given him by coach Luis Enrique and he has developed a stronger understanding with his team mates, especially Suarez.\nThe pair have netted 16 goals in Barca’s last seven games and for the first time in recent years, with Barca top of La Liga and leading their Champions League group, there is no talk of “Messi dependency”.\nThe debate over whether Messi, a four-time World Player of the Year, is irreplaceable has morphed into a discussion about whether the 23-year-old Neymar will be his worthy heir at the Nou Camp.\nMessi’s return against Real would clearly give a new dimension to the Barca attack whether he starts or is deployed off the bench.\nIt is 10 years this week since the 28-year-old played his first ‘Clasico’ and he has left an indelible mark with a record 21 goals in 30 matches against Barca’s arch rivals.\n“We are aware that Leo is the best in the world and we will always recognise that,” Suarez told a news conference on Wednesday.\n“Time will tell how good a forward line we are but it is true that we get on well and the whole team helps us to score goals.\n“Without the players behind us though we would be nothing and we wouldn’t achieve anything.”\nBarca’s Spain international Gerard Pique also pointed to the camaraderie among the trio — collectively known in Spain as “MNS” — as a reason for their success.\n“The key for these three is the relationship that they have,” Pique said in a recent interview with Britain’s Telegraph newspaper.\n“The only problem when you have players of this magnitude is the ego.\n“Suarez was the main man at Liverpool, Leo, before we had Suarez and Neymar, it was just him.\n“And how they connect — they do not have any ego and this is the most important part.”\nMessi, Neymar and Suarez hit a Spanish record 122 goals between them last season to fire Barca to a treble of Champions League, La Liga and King’s Cup titles and they match up favourably alongside the rich history of attacking flair at the Catalan club.\nIt may be difficult to compare players of different eras, and only since the arrival of Johan Cruyff as coach in the late 1980s with his revolutionary style of play have Barca regularly fielded three forwards, but the present trio stand out.\nMessi has figured in other memorable attacks, notably alongside Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto’o when they hit 100 goals in the 2008-09 treble-winning season.\nHis earlier partnership with Eto’o and Ronaldinho may have produced breathtaking football but their best scoring record was a combined 68 goals in the 2005-06 season.\nThe Brazilian Ronaldo produced some magical football for Barca alongside Luis Figo and Luis Enrique although their tally of 73 goals in 1996-97 is a long way short of the present forward line’s scoring feats.\nWith Barca three points clear at the top, the pressure is firmly on Real to find a way of stopping “MNS”.', 'Messi return to reunite ', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/19/messi-return-to-reunite-mns-for-the-clasico/', 12),

(221, '2015-11-20', '\nThe case of m.v. Avant Garde, a “floating armoury”, has acquired a new dimension since the Sri Lankan Navy boarded the vessel on October 6 to discover a massive stash of weapons on board.\nThe discovery has sounded a security alarm as the vessel, before being rested at the Galle harbour in eastern Sri Lanka, had been to the Indian territorial waters while carrying its cargo of weapons.\nLast weekend, on the order of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Sri Lankan Navy took over the ships cargo of more than 816 automatic rifles of different types and 2,02,674 rounds of ammunition. While the ship was part of Avant Garde Maritime Services (AGMS), allegedly linked to Sri Lanka’s Rajapaksa family, the massive cargo of weapons and ammunition has raised eyebrows of security analysts in South Asia, hinting that the boat could have been part of a maritime version of the “Purulia arms dropping case”.\nThe controversy over of Avant Garde Maritime Services (AGMS) snowballed since March when a Sri Lankan court stopped the former Defence Minister Gotabaya Rajapaksa from travelling abroad to investigate allegations that he used “floating armouries” in the Indian Ocean to help mercenaries and “private armies”. Sri Lankan official sources, on condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that the ships of Avant Garde Maritime Services were meant to protect the energy lanes of the Indian Ocean. The website of the company points out that it conducts security assistance services all the way up to the Red Sea.\nLt. Gen. (Retired) Prakash Katoch, a veteran of special military operations, told The Hindu that the reports of the boat having travelled through the territorial waters of India was disturbing and Sri Lanka should take India into confidence so that the destination and real intentions behind the boat’s cargo and the details of the Avant Garde Martime Services was known to India. “Presence of such a large number of arms on a single ship is unusual and naturally raises suspicion. India should ask Sri Lanka for whom were these arms exactly meant for,” he said.\nMaheshini Colonne, spokesperson of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, requested for time for the investigation to be over, adding that the case was complex. There have been allegations that the AGMS was unduly favoured by the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa and as a result caused losses to the Sri Lankan Navy.\nLt. Gen. (Retired) Katoch said that Sri Lankan authorities should help India investigate what was the “floating armoury” doing in the Indian territorial waters.\nSource: The Hindu', 'Questions over floating armoury in Indian territorial waters', 'http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=33131', 13),

And on the Croatia-Serbia border, Croats were only accepting people from those three countries plus Palestine, she said.\nSlovenia — the next country in the chain — also said it has been turning back the so-called economic migrants.\nSerbia has turned back to Macedonia some 200 migrants and Macedonia has not let them in, Sunjic said.\n“So they are stuck on a no man’s land,” she told The Associated Press.\nCroatia refused 162 migrants from Morocco rejected by Slovenia. Slovenia later Thursday said it will allow those migrants to proceed toward Austria.\n“This is going to be definitely a challenging situation,” Sunjic said. “UNHCR does not think that there is any nation that can be excluded from international protection based on their nationalities, but each case individually should be screened and processed based on the merits of the case.”\nIn the Greek border area of Idomeni, police said the border has essentially been shut down to all since about 8 a.m. after roughly 300 people, mostly from Iran, gathered at the crossing seeking to also be allowed through. A further 2,500 people are waiting at a camp nearby that provides temporary shelter for those heading north through the Balkans.\nThe partial closure of the borders could trigger huge pileups of desperate people along the Balkan corridor that has seen hundreds of thousands of people cross as they head to wealthy EU states, mostly Germany. Although Syrians are the biggest group among the asylum-seekers, tens of thousands of people fleeing poverty — such as Pakistanis, Bangladeshis or Sri Lankans — have also joined the surge.\nSerbian Labor Minister Aleksandar Vulin on Thursday blamed EU-members Slovenia and Croatia for the ban, saying they have started turning back economic migrants — those fleeing poverty, not war.\n“We have to protect our country. That is why we have applied reciprocal measures toward the people Slovenia and Croatia have no room for,” Vulin said.\nSlovenia’s decision to start turning back people it considers economic migrants triggered the chain reaction along the Balkan migrant route.\nSlovenian police spokesman Drago Menegalia said in recent days, “there is increased number of persons who were recognized as pure economic migrants” entering the small Alpine state from Croatia.\n“These foreigners do not qualify for international protection,” according to EU laws, he said.\nSlovenian officials say they will continue to allow the transit of refugees from war-ravaged countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq pass through on their way to Austria and other richer EU states.\nSource: AP', 'Macedonia bars refugees from Sri Lanka', 'http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=33128', 13),
