And the game''s governing body, not wanting the superstar to go without a memento for his achievements on the pitch because of his good-natured actions, have ''dug out a spare'' to send home with him. ''World Rugby would like every winner this evening to go home with a medal, so they''ve rummaged in the store cupboard and they have found the final one,'' said the event''s host Alex Payne, before Williams was given a standing ovasion. But the centre has played down the exceptional nature of the incident, saying it could have been any one of his team-mates. ''I''m really surprised, most of the boys would have done the same,'' he said. Williams was unaware he would be presented with a replacement medal but World Cup organisers acted following a request from the New Zealand players and management. When on stage Williams also asked if team-mate Jerome Kaino would be given a new All Blacks beanie hat, with the flanker having given his to teenager Lines on Saturday night. The sensational moment occurred when Charlie Lines, 15, burst on to the Twickenham pitch after the final whistle confirmed a 34-17 final victory over Australia in search of an autograph, but Williams made sure he left the ground with much more.

He said that even though the country has great potential, it has inherited a culture of being happy with the past instead of looking towards the future and that economists should predict changes and suggest reforms to the country’s socio-cultural, political and economic environment. “So, for the reforms and changes needed for these, we will have to accelerate development in a productive manner, without backing down or wasting time,” he added. Sirisena went on to say that poverty is the biggest challenge the country has to its development. “We will have to achieve a lot to eliminate poverty, become a developed country and develop an environment of happiness where we can release the prisoners filling our prisons and develop a suitably good society,” he said. He noted that Sri Lanka has achieved more than some other countries by introducing concepts such as sustainable development, green economics, knowledge-based economics, and innovation. “This is due to the developed knowledge of our citizens, our literacy rates our ability to absorb and adapt to situations and for being born in a beautiful and important country. We should enter the international competitive markets in a fast and cultured manner,” he said. However, reverting to protectionist political rhetoric and appealing to the rural vote ahead of the upcoming local elections, he said that many of the country’s problems are also caused by foreign influences, and that Sri Lanka should grow its own food. “In 2014, we had imported Rs.60 billion worth of food which could have been grown here. We forget our heritage and opt for foreign things. We must only embrace technology while protecting our culture and heritage,” he added. President Sirisena regularly incorporates Buddhist chants into his speeches. A key message of Buddhism is that change is inevitable. Economists say such protectionist policies will go against competitive advantages and productivity-based industries required for international markets and would likely continue to trap the 30 percent of the country’s labour force in the agriculture sector which accounts for just 10 percent of the GDP.\n', 'Reforms key to Sri Lanka becoming major export destination: President ', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/93499/reforms-key-to-sri-lanka-becoming-major-export-destination-president', 2),

(24, '2015-11-02 21:44:48', '\nREUTERS: Sri Lanka paid less than it had expected to borrow US $ 1.5 billion via a 10-year sovereign bond on Tuesday, with strong orders helping bring down the yield on the issue to 6.85 percent from initial guidance of around 7 percent. The Finance Ministry will use the funds to help plug a gap in the budget, government sources said. After the August 17 election, the new government said it would not be able to limit the 2015 deficit to a targeted 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) due to heavy spending and weak revenue.  Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has said the deficit is likely to reach 6.5-6.8 percent of GDP. The size of the issue matched the initially planned amount after orders came in for US $ 3.3 billion across 290 accounts, with 55 percent of the orders coming from the United States, 29 percent from Europe and the rest from the Asia. Of the accounts, 88 percent represented fund managers, 9 percent represented banks and 3 percent bid on behalf of pensions and insurance funds. In a statement early on Tuesday assigning a ‘B+’ rating to the bond, Standard & Poor’s put the size of the issue at US $ 1 billion.  But it later corrected its release to say the size had not been decided. Currency dealers and economists had varied on the government’s ability to borrow whole US $ 1.5 billion at 7 percent. Amal Sanderatne, Chief Economist and CEO at Colombo-based Frontier Research, called the initial pricing guidance “very high” compared to past Sri Lankan sovereign bonds. On May 28, the country had raised US $ 650 million via a 10-year sovereign bond after aiming for US $ 1 billion. That bond carried a 6.125 percent per annum yield. But given Sri Lanka’s low foreign currency reserves and an uncertain global interest rate environment, a high pricing “is something they need to do,” Sanderatne said. Sri Lanka’s reserves stood at US $ 6.5 billion in August, well down from US $ 8.8 billion in October 2014 as the Central Bank propped up the rupee while keeping interest rates low.  After facing heavy pressure on its reserves, the Central Bank opted to let the currency float on September 4. Sri Lanka, rated B1/B+/BB- by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively, mandated Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered for the US dollar bond offering, the people familiar with the plans said. S&P said its Sri Lanka sovereign credit rating “reflects the country’s relatively low wealth, improving but still moderately weak external liquidity, and a high government debt and interest burden.” The International Monetary Fund has raised concerns about Sri Lanka’s revenue shortfall and says the government needs to implement tough reforms, including tax measures, to address the matter.  Bond oversubscription testifies investor confidence in Sri Lanka: StanChart CEO The oversubscription of the country’s latest international bond issue is a testament of the confidence investors and markets have in Sri Lanka and its growth story, according to Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart) CEO Jim McCabe.  “This is the country’s largest bond issue to date and the oversubscription of 2.2 times strongly reflects the confidence investors and markets have in Sri Lanka and its growth story,” he said.  “Once more the Central Bank has taken a bold step in order to take advantage of market conditions with this new issue, and I congratulate the team on this success,” McCabe added.  Standard Chartered acted as the Sovereign Raging Advisor, Joint Lead Manager and Joint Bookrunner to the issue. This was Standard Chartered’s forth issuance for the Sri Lanka Sovereign. Standard Chartered Director Head Financial Institutions Lakshan Goonetilleke commenting the deal said, “Markets have been extremely volatile but the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) bonds continue to outperform similar rates Asian bonds.” The timeline was extremely tight during a time of significant economic releases— PBOC’s and the EU Central Bank’s announced benchmark rate cut and quantitative easing plans, respectively, the highly anticipated U.S. FOMC announcement of a possible rate hike, and the GOSL’s 2016 budget announcement on November 20.', 'Sri Lanka sells US $ 1.5bn, 10-year sovereign bond at 6.85% yield', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/93027/sri-lanka-sells-us-1-5bn-10-year-sovereign-bond-at-6-85-yield', 2),

This will help bolster the currency, at least in the short term, and also ease pressure on interest rates,” Sanjeewa Fernando, a Colombo-based strategist at CT CLSA Securities was quoted as saying to Bloomberg. A 10-year sovereign bond issued by Sri Lanka this year at 6.125 percent at a price guidance of 6.375 percent was quoted around 6.5/6 percent in the secondary market, the Bloomberg wire data showed.  Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank are said to be marketing the bond. Standard & Poor’s Ratings (S&P) assigning ‘B+’ rating to the issue yesterday said the proposed bond has a 10-year maturity period. Fitch Ratings assigned the issue with an expected rating of ‘BB-‘with Stable Outlook.  “The sovereign credit rating on Sri Lanka reflects the country’s relatively low wealth, improving but still moderately weak external liquidity, and a high government debt and interest burden,” S&P noted. “In addition, while the government has recently taken steps to strengthen governance, we consider the current gaps in institutional capacity to pose risks to Sri Lanka’s institutional and governance effectiveness.  These rating constraints weigh against the country’s robust growth prospects,” the rating agency added.   Sri Lanka’s budget deficit for 2015 is estimated to hit 6.9 percent of the GDP against the projected 4.4 percent amid higher expenditure and legislative debacles in approving revenue proposals in parliament.  A senior economist in the country recently recommended Sri Lanka to go for another International Monetary Fund (IMF) bail out before the economy hits a crisis point.  The factors that were listed by S&P as assisting Sri Lanka’s growth were government investment, including measures to reconstruct the northern districts, the improving financial performance of public enterprises, increasing tourist arrivals, and declining inflation, which the rating agency expects to remain in the single digits.', 'Sri Lanka opts for another dollar bond to cut fiscal deficit', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/92907/sri-lanka-opts-for-another-dollar-bond-to-cut-fiscal-deficit', 2),

During his visit to India last month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that negotiations on an ‘economic pact’ would be finalized by the end of this year and signed by mid-2016. However, criticism has been levelled that economic pacts cannot be negotiated within 4 months, when advanced economies typically spend nearly or over a decade in negotiations to ascertain long-term economic and social impacts of such partnerships. Sources close to the new regime divulged last month itself that the framework of the new partnership would revolve around Sri Lanka and India exchanging professionals in certain economic sectors based on the urgent needs of each country, with the exchanges limited by quotas. The new pact was hastily conceptualized during the Premier’s three day trip, as intense public pressure rose on the days leading up to Wickremesinghe’s departure against a notion that the new regime intends to renegotiate the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). CEPA—an expansion of the existing Indo Lanka Free Trade Agreement which deals with goods—was not signed due to protectionist business elements mounting a similar opposition in 2008. When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka early this year, he said that signing CEPA should be an immediate priority of the two countries. CEPA was to address the free movement of people, investments and services. However, general consensus was that the past regime conducted negotiations without any transparency, going so far as to arbitrarily change some elements in the final draft. The document has not surfaced since 2008. The agreement may have been an attempted political balancing act of the past regime, which was building close relationships with China and facilitating a greater Chinese control in the Indian Ocean. Protectionist elements said that CEPA would have opened Sri Lanka to Indians ranging across the economic and social spectrums, displacing Sri Lankans in their own country. However, officials engaged in the negotiations, as well as Dr. de Silva have continuously said that there were extensive safeguards to open up the economy in a sector-by-sector basis, similar to the new Broader Economic Technology Partnership. The new regime may run into the same problems as its predecessor if it does not proceed in a transparent manner with wide stakeholder engagement. Dr. de Silva said that Sri Lankans must become open minded and engage with the outer world competitively instead of cocooning themselves in the domestic market. “We must get out of this prison that we are different from other people. Look at Vietnam, they have done great... Why don’t we want to have a better trade agreement with India?” he asked.\n', 'Hastily drafted tech pact with India to be reviewed: Harsha', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/92293/hastily-drafted-tech-pact-with-india-to-be-reviewed-harsha', 2),

Dialog Axiata PLC is a subsidiary of Axiata Group Berhad, Asia’s second largest telco with operations in eight countries spanning Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and India.  The Axiata group (formerly known as Telekom Malaysia International) has been a committed and long-term investor in Sri Lanka since 1994. Speaking soon after the inking of the investment agreements, Axiata Group President and CEO Dato Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim stated, “The Axiata group is proud and privileged to have had the opportunity to work alongside the Government of Sri Lanka in developing the country’s connectivity sector to one of the best in the region.  Axiata is a long-term partner of Sri Lanka and as evidenced by the investment agreements entered into today, we have singular confidence in the Government of Sri Lanka and its vision for the forward development of the country’s ICT sector and economy through the prioritization of inclusive connectivity and digital infrastructure.”  The additional investment pledged through the agreements entered into with the BoI will take the total investment of Dialog Axiata to Rs.206.0 billion (US $ 1.96 billion), the highest among all FDI operating under the aegis of the BoI. In 2011, Dialog and the Axiata group secured the distinction of being the first FDI to reach a cumulative investment in excess of US $ 1 billion.  “The commitment by the Axiata group and Dialog, to enter into a new phase of its development journey with an investment of US $ 175 million demonstrates the confidence placed by this leading multi-national telecommunications provider in the growth prospects of Sri Lanka’s economy and the investment environment fostered by the BoI and adjacent agencies of the Government of Sri Lanka.  The BoI is confident that this next phase of investment embarked upon by Dialog will greatly support the thrust of the Government of Sri Lanka in enabling a digitally empowered society,” said BoI Chairman and Director General Upul Jayasuriya. “We are most welcoming of this renewed investment thrust by the largest investor operating under the BoI. A repeat investment by an existing investor is a singular endorsement of the excellent investment environment in Sri Lanka,” he added. In addition to leading in the sphere of FDI, the operations of the Dialog Axiata group contribute significantly to the national economy, with the taxes and levies remitted in the year 2014 alone, totalling to Rs.11.1 billion, alongside an additional Rs.13.3 billion in consumption taxes collected on behalf of the government.  “We wish to thank the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, as well as the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, Media Ministry and Central Bank of Sri Lanka for providing us with an exceptionally progressive enabling environment which has facilitated us in delivering an inclusive portfolio of advanced ICT services, which have in turn contributed to the socio-economic advancement of a wide spectrum of citizens and communities,” said Dialog Axiata PLC Director/Group Chief Executive Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya. “As espoused in our investment pledge, we will continue our thrust in supporting the vision of the Government of Sri Lanka in accelerating the advancement of Sri Lanka’s digital economy through the delivery of affordable and plural available services of the highest quality,” he added.', 'Dialog Axiata and BoI sign Rs.24.6bn investment agreement', 'http://www.dailymirror.lk/92137/dialog-axiata-and-boi-sign-rs-24-6bn-investment-agreement', 2),

He is a cute baby monkey that is so innocent and, most of the time, has no idea what is going one.  He depends on his mom for protection.  Maya is on the low end of the social hierarchy.  She is a female monkey with a nice personality unlike the three sister queens who act as if they own everything.  I love how Maya protects her baby at all costs.   This is the eighth True Adventure film and the sixth released theatrically by Disney nature, the in dependent film label of Walt Disney Studio.

It’s crazy.”\nAsked what she plans to do with so many glittering prizes, she added with a huge grin: “My mom … puts them in a safe and I do not know the combination.”\nSolving the riddle of how to beat Biles and Uchimura will no doubt cause a lot of anxiety to their rivals going into 2016.\nWhile Biles will arrive at the Rio Olympics a three-times all-around world champion,Japan’s Uchimura showed that his appetite for gold remains insatiable.\nThe holder of a record six successive world all-around titles ended the theatrical celebrations of American Danell Leyva, and his step-father-coach Yin Alvarez, with a high-flying routine on the horizontal bar that drew 15.833.\nA performance that had the crowd oohing and aahhing with every one of his four release manoeuvres secured him a third gold in Glasgow, taking his overall worlds medal tally to 19.\nIt did not seem to satisfy Uchimura.\n“I want to see the Japanese flag rising more than three times,” he declared, having taken his overall medal tally at the worlds to 19, with 10 of them being gold.\nThe record is held by Belarus’ Vitaly Scherbo, who won a total of 23 world championship medals including 12 golds.\nWhile Biles and Uchimura were the leading lights on Sunday, Ri Se-gwang was saluting North Korea’s flag as his country’s national anthem was played for the second year running following his success in the vault final.\nThe 30-year-old took a step forward following his first vault — a piked double front summersault with half twist — and then stuck his tongue out bashfully when he failed to nail the second one cleanly.\nBut there was so much difficulty packed into his Tsukahara full-twisting double back effort, that the stumbled landing did not really dent his average score.\nHis mark of 15.450 edged out Marian Dragulescu by 0.050 of a point — the Romanian jumping into the arms of his coach after winning his 10th world medal, 14 years after earning his first.\nYou Hao ended a week of disappointment for China’s men as he captured their first gold medal in Glasgow by eclipsing Ukrainian defending champion Oleg Verniaiev by 0.15 of a point in the parallel bars final.

No mistakes, no gust of wind,” he said, a dig at Rosberg’s U.S. error that the German blamed on windy conditions.\nHamilton had clearly opposed the team’s decision to bring him in for an unscheduled second pitstop, with sceptics inevitably speculating about team orders, and ignored it initially.\n“Can I ask why?,” he enquired. “My tyres feel good.”\nHe obeyed when it was made clear that it was for safety reasons due after an inspection of the tyres used in the first stint showed excessive wear.\nThe high-altitude Mexico straight is one of the longest and fastest on the calendar with cars reaching speeds in excess of 360kph.\nNeither Ferrari finished the race, ending a run of 20 in the points, with Vettel’s team mate Kimi Raikkonen breaking his suspension after colliding with Bottas for the second time in three races.\nBottas, who had been trying to pass on the inside when they tangled wheels, raced on to take a revenge podium.\nIn Russia last month, Raikkonen wrecked Bottas’s hopes of third place when he tried to pass on the last lap and sent his compatriot into the barriers.\n“That is what you call payback,” commented former F1 driver David Coulthard on the BBC. The stewards investigated and decided to take no further action.\nVettel had a nightmare afternoon, picking up a puncture on the first lap after banging wheels with Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and then spinning.\nRussian Daniil Kvyat was fourth for Red Bull, ahead of Australian Ricciardo with Brazilian Felipe Massa sixth for Williams.\nThe Force India pair of Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez, the local hero and crowd favourite, finished seventh and eighth.\nPerez, whose every appearance in the baseball stadium area had the crowd leaping in excitement, became the first Mexican to score a point in a home race since Pedro Rodriguez in 1970 and only the second ever\n“I will remember this weekend forever,” said the 25-year-old. “I think everybody has enjoyed the energy of the crowd and this must surely be one of the most popular races on the calendar now.”\nToro Rosso’s Dutch teenager Max Verstappen was ninth and Romain Grosjean 10th for Lotus.\nMcLaren’s Fernando Alonso lasted just one lap before having to retire with a loss of power.', 'Rosberg wins in Mexico a week after title defeat', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/02/rosberg-wins-in-mexico-a-week-after-title-defeat/', 5),

Hamilton has not started from pole since the Italian Grand Prix in early September.\nRosberg clocked a best lap of one minute and 19.480 seconds to outpace Hamilton by 0.188 seconds.\nMercedes team chief Toto Wolff had an easy explanation for Rosberg’s speed.\n“Angry…” he said, referring to the 30-year-old German’s tetchy reaction to being pushed off-track by Hamilton on the opening lap last weekend.\nThat failure to exploit pole and win represented another failure in Rosberg’s current travails as he seeks to improve on just two wins from his last 10 pole positions.\nWith 20 poles, Rosberg has the most by any driver not to have won a world title.\n“I have felt good all weekend and been fast here,” he said.\n“It’s very good to start from pole and there is a very long run down to Turn One and I am sure we have a good ‘race’ car so it should be interesting, an interesting battle!”\nHamilton, once again, wound up second after making key mistakes on his best laps.\n“There were a couple of moments when the car felt spectacular, but there are a few places where I can improve – my driving and my set-up.

Vettel went second, slower by two-tenths, but just ahead of Rosberg as rain fell.\nThat did nothing to deter Verstappen and Massa who improved to grab their places in the final shootout, pushing Spaniard Carlos Sainz out in 11th for Toro Rosso.\nHe was just ahead of Romain Grosjean and his Lotus team-mate Pastor Maldonado, Marcus Ericsson of Sauber and Kimi Raikkonen, who had brake problems with his Ferrari.', '‘', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/01/angry-rosberg-takes-pole-in-mexico/', 5),

Anyone can make a mistake. He made two very good saves during the match as well, because he is a very good goalkeeper,” Pellegrini said.\n“Of course I think we deserved to win. We tried to score from the beginning. Norwich defended very well, and it was very difficult to create the space.\n“We created three or four chances, but we scored through a beautiful goal from Otamendi.\n“They drew level with what was an unlucky ball for us. It was not good play from them.\n“We demonstrated character and belief in the last eight minutes.\n“We scored a clear penalty and missed another. We struggled in creating space at times, but I think we deserved three points.”\nThe Canaries’ fourth successive league defeat angered Neil, who was unhappy with Ruddy’s mistake and the way his team defended the corner from which Otamendi headed City’s opener.\n“I think if you look at the goals we’ve been conceding, it’s been down to individuals,” Neil said.\n“The players have got to be big enough and brave enough to deal with situations, and at the moment, we’re not doing that.”\nNeil’s decision to play three centre-backs for the first time this season, in a 5-4-1 formation, did much to frustrate their opponents for long spells of the game.\nAnd after going behind to Otamendi’s header, they looked as if they would save a point when Jerome tapped in following Hart’s error, only to end up losing the match.\nNeil’s plan was intended to frustrate a City team who had scored 18 goals in their previous four home games.\n“It’s easy to set up a team defensively,” he said. “It’s harder to set up a side who can be solid but create chances as well, which was what we were trying to do.\n“Given some of the recent results they’ve had, it would have been naive to go toe to toe with them.\n“The game plan was to frustrate them and try to hurt them on the counter attack.\n“If you face a team with a bit of quality, and they score a great goal, you hold your hand up, but to lose a goal from a set piece because someone doesn’t pick up their man is frustrating.\n“We got back into the game, but after that, it was just basic errors.

I’m happy to get through over such a dangerous opponent.\n“I knew his game after we practised together in Dubai in December, we put in 10-15 hours on the court, played tons of sets.\n“He’s a great player with the footwork, the power, the tennis IQ.”\nNadal, the 14-time Grand Slam champion, will next face France’s Richard Gasquet who survived 32 aces from Ivo Karlovic to keep his hopes of a World Tour Finals place alive with a 6-4, 6-7 (2/7), 7-6 (8/6) win.\nNadal began turning his match with 2014 US Open champion Cilic on its head after going down a set and a break.\nThe Spaniard retrieved the break in the fourth game, 2-2, with a forehand winner.\nHe then took a 5-3 lead as Cilic delivered three double-faults to lose serve in an eight-minute game, opening the door for Nadal to push through.\nWith the sets level, Nadal went to work closing out the evening, breaking to start the third and concluding with another break as the Croatian ended with seven double-faults while losing serve four times in two and a quarter hours.\n“I was just fighting, always trying to find solutions in a difficult situation,” said Nadal.\n“He played a great first set and it was tough to find any chances on return.\n“I changed my position (on return) a bit in the second set and it seemed to work well. This was an important victory for me against someone playing very well.”\nCilic fired 37 winners but was undone by 49 unforced errors and is now 0-11 against top 10 players since winning the 2014 US Open.\nThe 29-year-old Nadal’s confidence is fast returning after a slow start to 2015 and some indifferent play in the ensuing months when his ranking slumped to a 10-year low.\n“I needed to play with the right tactic and motivation and try to improve every day,” said Nadal.\n“It’s not easy but I’m working hard to find the feelings and find the mental strength to come back.”\nNadal has already qualified for the World Tour Finals to be staged in London from November 15 along with Novak Djokovic, Federer, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and Tomas Berdych.\nGasquet is chasing one of the last two spots remaining in the eight-player finale.\nBut the Frenchman with the picture-book, single-handed backhand faces almost impossible odds, needing to win the Basel title this weekend and next week’s Paris Masters.\nAnything less will send rivals Kei Nishikori and Spain’s David Ferrer to the year-end showpiece.', 'Federer, Nadal battle into Swiss semi-finals', 'http://sports.dailymirror.lk/2015/11/01/federer-nadal-battle-into-swiss-semi-finals/', 5),

They put us under pressure and scored a couple of tries and made a real game of it,” said Carter.\nHowever, urging on the weary-looking All Blacks, he stilled the Wallaby fightback with a superbly-taken 35-metre drop-goal — only the eighth of his Test career — 11 minutes from time to give New Zealand a seven-point lead at 24-17.\nHe then kicked a penalty to make the game safe before converting replacement back Beauden Barrett’s late try.\nCarter admitted afterwards he had struggled to avoid contemplating the prospect of victory in the days leading up to the final.\n“I’ve been fighting those thoughts all week…I kept pulling myself back to the process and concentrating on the task in hand and I thought I did that well for the 80 minutes.\n“Once that final whistle went, it was a great opportunity to release the emotions and I’m so proud.”\nCarter kicked three penalties and then landed a difficult touchline conversion of a try by wing Nehe Milner-Skudder on the stroke of half-time to ease the All Blacks into a 16-3 interval lead.\nBut his tactical kicking out of hand was also typically top-class as well.\nCarter’s drop-goal was the best of his scores on Saturday and arguably the most important.\n“It was just like Richie (New Zealand captain Richie McCaw) was saying about guys just doing their job,” said All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster.\n“When we needed him to step up and make some decisions and go out on a bit of a limb and have a crack at the drop-kick again, he did it.”\nThere were a couple of worrying moments when Carter was tackled late and then high by Australia prop Sekope Kepu in two separate incidents just five first-half minutes apart.\nBut to the relief of New Zealand fans everywhere, he kept going.\nCarter’s tally of 1,598 Test points is 352 more than England great Jonny Wilkinson managed in his career.\nThe 708 points in 56 appearances by Japan’s Ayumu Goromaru is now the highest total by an active international.\nFoster added: “He (Carter) should be really satisfied with what he’s done.

This finding is also backed by the team from Sri Lanka,” he said without releasing their findings.\nThe FBI found that debris from the blast, at first considered possible remnants of a bomb, were in fact parts of the boat, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.\nThe Maldives asked the US, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, India and Australia for help with the blast investigation.\nSince the explosion, the president has ordered a major shake-up of his security and sacked several of his ministers, while several of Adeeb’s associates have also been arrested.\nNaseer said on Sunday that eight suspects have fled the country and are known to be hiding in neighbouring Sri Lanka and in Thailand, along with other unidentified countries.\nGuns and ammunition were discovered on Saturday hidden at the bottom of the sea off an atoll north of Male. Police have linked the finding to an associate of Adeeb’s as they push ahead with their investigation.\nYameen appealed for calm after Adeeb’s arrest last month, which sparked protests by his supporters and intensified a political crisis in the country already hit by political power struggles and a crackdown on dissent.\nThe Maldives has faced tough international criticism over the jailing in March of its first democratically elected leader Mohamed Nasheed, after a rushed trial which the UN said was seriously flawed.\nYameen, who came to power in November 2013 following a controversial election, faces international censure over his crackdown on supporters of opposition leader Nasheed and other opponents of his regime.\nYameen is the half-brother of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the island with an iron fist for 30 years before losing the island’s first genuine elections to Nasheed.\nNasheed was toppled about three years later when security chiefs and judges appointed by Gayoom revolted against attempted reforms.

If the NPC does not do it, the world will not take the Tamils’ contention that they had been subjected to genocide, seriously,” Sumanthiran said.\n“The Tamils cannot condemn the misdeeds of the Sinhalese majority while ignoring the misdeeds of the Tamil majority,” the  Jaffna district MP further said.  \nAsked if he plans to take up the matter with the NPC, which is dominated by the TNA, he said: “ I am not a member of the NPC. I have given my view. It’s for them to carry it forward.”\nBetween October and November 1990, Muslims were asked to leave in less than 24 hours. Each person was allowed only LKR 150 to LKR 2000 and a single change of clothing. All other properties were confiscated. Of the displaced, 20,000 continue to live in squalid camps in Puttalam, north of Colombo.\nResettlement of the returnees has been problematical in Mannar district. While some resident Tamils have questioned the returnees’ claims, the Central government had designated some Muslim farms as “forest land”.\nThe Lankan military also occupies some Muslim farmlands. According to Hilmy Ahamed of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, some forest land had been cleared to settle 3500 Sinhalese families from Hambantota and Suriuyawewa.\nForeign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said that the justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be set up by the Lankan government following the September 30 UN Human Rights Council’s resolution on Sri Lanka, will address the grievances of the displaced Muslims.

He escaped unhurt because he wasn’t sitting in his usual seat on the boat, the government said. His wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured.\nThe FBI said in a statement that the “submitted specimens were determined to be components from the boat and not the components of an improvised explosive device.” \n“Based on the FBI’s analysis —which included forensic analysis of the scene, analysis of the items recovered from the scene, and chemical testing — there is no conclusive evidence to attribute the explosion on the boat to an IED,” it added.\nThe Maldives sought assistance from the FBI, as well as investigators from Sri Lanka, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia.\nHome Minister Umar Nazeer has said previously that the investigation by Sri Lankan experts found that the explosion was caused by a device that was small and designed not to kill everyone on board. According to Nazeer, it was meant to kill or incapacitate the president. Nazeer did not say anything about the type of the explosive device or how it was detonated. He did not answer phone calls seeking comment on Saturday and Sunday.\nHe seemed to have contradicted the FBI statement, writing on his Twitter account that “FBI examiners did not conclude that there was no IED in the blast.ie: they did not rule out an IED” on the boat.\nInvestigators from India, Australia and Saudi Arabia have not yet released the results of their probes.\nThe explosion took place as Gayoom and his wife were returning to the capital from the airport, which is on a separate island.
